# Hello World SwiftUI Implementation

## Overview
A standalone SwiftUI "Hello World" welcome screen that appears when users first open the RadonEye app. This implementation is completely independent of storyboards and showcases modern SwiftUI design.

## What It Does
- **Always Shows First**: Every app launch displays the welcome screen
- **Pure SwiftUI**: No storyboard dependencies 
- **Hello World Focus**: Prominently displays "Hello World" with Aeonik Pro Bold
- **Modern Design**: Beautiful gradient background and typography

## Files Modified
- Modified `viewLanch.swift` - Contains embedded SwiftUI view and presentation logic

## Additional Files (Optional)
- `WelcomeView.swift` - Standalone SwiftUI welcome view (for reference)
- `WelcomeViewController.swift` - UIKit hosting controller (for reference)

## User Experience
1. App launches with splash screen
2. After 1 second, SwiftUI welcome screen appears
3. Beautiful "Hello World" message displayed
4. **Two navigation buttons**:
   - **"New SwiftUI App"** (primary) - Navigate to new SwiftUI implementation
   - **"Original App"** (secondary) - Navigate to existing UIKit app
5. **Back buttons** on both destination views to return to welcome screen

## Technical Details
- **Font**: Aeonik Pro Bold (52pt) for "Hello World"
- **Colors**: App's existing gradient (tilt blue to background)
- **Status Bar**: Light content for gradient background
- **Layout**: Responsive design with proper spacing

## How It Works
```
App Launch → viewLanch → presentWelcomeScreen() → createWelcomeView() → SwiftUI Welcome View
                                                                              ↓
                                                                    Two Navigation Options:
                                                                              ↓
┌─ "New SwiftUI App" → navigateToNewImplementation() → createNewMainView() → SwiftUI Main View [Back Button]
│                                                                                              ↓
└─ "Original App" → navigateToMainView() → performSegue("goDeviceList") → UIKit Device List [Back Button]
                                                                                              ↓
                                                                              Back to Welcome Screen
```

The implementation provides a choice between the new SwiftUI implementation and the original UIKit app, both with back navigation to the welcome screen.
